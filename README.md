# gShellApiGenerator
PoSh API Generator

The PoSh API Generator is planned to generate a full working PowerShell API client library (and documentation) for a given Google API by way of reflecting over the C# API Library already provided by Google, through Nuget.

Each API Library will be based on a core, manually-created gShell library that handles the authentication and central logic for the APIs.

At this time the project is in its infancy, so please be patient.

Once completed the ambition is to provide a sustainable way to provide PowerShell APIs through the PowerShell Gallery.

Please stay tuned.
